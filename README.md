# <Project Horiseon - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor>

## Description

To be able to prepare myself in Coding, I am applying what I learned on HTML, CSS, and Git to this
project, refactoring for more consistent, simplified and optimum code without breaking it, to the best of of my knowledge. 


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](Assets/HoriseonSS.jpeg)
    ```
